1.  If you are reconfiguring this product, you _must_ use the config/
    bootstrap script.  The standard "configure" script is edited to
    produce a working script.

2.  You _must_ have a very recent libtool.  There are always more fixes,
    but it is still easier than trying to write your own link
    commands....

3.  If you have pulled the sources from CVS, there are a number of files
    that are required to build, but not part of the archive.  The needed
    sources are contained within a shar archive named "noag-boot.sh".
