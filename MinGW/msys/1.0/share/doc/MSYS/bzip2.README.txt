msys bzip2
===============================================================================
bzip2 is a freely available, patent free (see below), high-quality data
compressor. It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best
available techniques (the PPM family of statistical compressors), whilst being
around twice as fast at compression and six times faster at decompression.

Notes:   This is a binary release of the bzip2 compression/decompression
         library, compiled for use with MSYS applications.

         The source code is modified from that distributed by bzip.org,
         to fix various security holes, correct build errors, and add
         new features.  In addition, the original build system has been
         completely replaced by an autoconf-based one (see README.CYGMING
         for more information).

         The "src" tarball delivers the full unmodified source code from
         bzip.org, along with the relevant patches and (external) build
         driver (.mgwport) script.

         The "doc", "lic" and "man" tarballs provide the documentation
         components, as identified above, abstracted from the source
         tarball, and repackaged into a file hierarchy structure which
         is suitable for installation into the user's installed MSYS
         directory hierarchy; for a standard installation, they should
         be unpacked into the C:\MinGW\msys\1.0 directory.

         The "bin" tarball provides the bzip2.exe compression utility, along
         with several other utilities and scripts. This package should be
         unpacked into the C:\MinGW\msys\1.0 directory.

         Developers of MSYS applications, who wish to link to the bzip2
         libraries, will require at least the "dev" tarball; this provides
         the libbz2.a static version of the library, libbz2.dll.a import
         library, for linking to a DLL version of the library, and the set
         of C language headers common to both.  The DLL version of the
         library, msys-bz2-1.dll, is provided separately, by the "dll-1"
         tarball.  As in the case of the installable documentation, each of
         these tarballs should be unpacked into the C:\MinGW\msys\1.0
         directory.

         Please note that the msys-bz2-1.dll delivered by this package
         depends on the MSYS runtime msys-1.0.dll. Developers need to
         install and use the msys-system-builder (aka msys-dvlpr)
         toolkit to compile clients of this library; it may NOT be used
         in conjunction with the MinGW compiler (which generates native
         win32 binaries, rather than MSYS-dependent ones).

Port Notes:

1) This msys build of bzip2 DOES NOT support 64 bit file access (large files),
   because the msys runtime does not support 64bit off_t.

2) This build is based on the cygwin source patches, NOT any MinGW
   ones. It is only "lightly" ported -- that is, the sources have not
   been modified to recognize #define __MSYS__.  Therefore, when compiling
   against this library, you should explicitly define the __CYGWIN__
   macro, by adding -D__CYGWIN__ to your CFLAGS (msys-gcc-3.4.4-3 does this
   automatically).

3) (internal:) the original, and rather dated and inflexible, build system
   has been completely replaced by a new autoconf-based one, contributed
   by Keith Marshall. This allows for (a) out-of-tree builds, (b) cross-
   compiler builds, and (c) better handling for win32/cygwin builds.
   However, this original contribution required some additional tweaks, to
   support MSYS.

4) (internal:) The build and packaging is driven by an external .msysport
   script, to handle the specifics of package creation and naming suitable
   for use with the mingw-get installation program.
