.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page briefly documents the \fBcolumns\fP command.
This program was designed for the purpose of generating compact,
columnized tables.  It will read a list of text items from standard
in or a specified input file and produce a columnized listing of
all the non-blank lines.  Leading white space on each line is
preserved, but trailing white space is stripped.  Methods of
applying per-entry and per-line embellishments are provided.
See the formatting and separation arguments below.

This program is used by AutoGen to help clean up and organize
its output.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-W " \fInum\fP, " \--width "=" \fInum\fP
Maximum Line Width.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of \fInum\fP is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
in the range  16 through 4095
.fi
.in -4
The default \fInum\fP for this option is:
.ti +4
 79
.sp
This option specifies the full width of the output line,
including any start-of-line indentation.  The output will fill
each line as completely as possible, unless the column width has
been explicitly specified.  If the maximum width is less than
the length of the widest input, you will get a single column
of output.
.TP
.BR \-c " \fIcount\fP, " \--columns "=" \fIcount\fP
Desired number of columns.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of \fIcount\fP is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
in the range  1 through 2048
.fi
.in -4
The default \fIcount\fP for this option is:
.ti +4
 0
.sp
Use this option to specify exactly how many columns to produce.
If that many columns will not fit within \fBline_width\fP, then
the count will be reduced to the number that fit.
.TP
.BR \-w " \fInum\fP, " \--col-width "=" \fInum\fP
Set width of each column.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of \fInum\fP is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
in the range  1 through 2048
.fi
.in -4
The default \fInum\fP for this option is:
.ti +4
 0
.sp
Use this option to specify exactly how many characters are to be
allocated for each column.  If it is narrower than the widest entry,
it will be over-ridden with the required width.
.TP
.BR \--spread "=\fInum\fP"
maximum spread added to column width.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of \fInum\fP is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
in the range  1 through 1024
.fi
.in -4
The default \fInum\fP for this option is:
.ti +4
 0
.sp
Use this option to specify exactly how many characters may be
added to each column.  It allows you to prevent columns from
becoming too far apart.
.TP
.BR \--fill
Fill lines with input.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
spread, col_width, separation, line_separation, by_columns, sort.
.sp
Instead of columnizing the input text, fill the output lines
with the input lines.  Blank lines on input will cause a
blank line in the output.
.TP
.BR \-I " \fIl-pfx\fP, " \--indent "=" \fIl-pfx\fP
Line prefix or indentation.
.sp
If a number, then this many spaces will be inserted at the start of
every line.  Otherwise, it is a line prefix that will be inserted
at the start of every line.
.TP
.BR \--first-indent "=\fIl-pfx\fP"
First line prefix.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
indent.
.sp
If a number, then this many spaces will be inserted at the start of
the first line.  Otherwise, it is a line prefix that will be inserted
at the start of that line.
.TP
.BR \--tab-width "=\fInum\fP"
tab width.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The default \fInum\fP for this option is:
.ti +4
 8
.sp
If an indentation string contains tabs, then this value is used to
compute the ending column of the prefix string.
.TP
.BR \-s " \fIkey-pat\fP, " \--sort [ =\fIkey-pat\fP ]
Sort input text.
.sp
Causes the input text to be sorted.  If an argument is supplied,
it is presumed to be a pattern and the sort is based upon the
matched text.  If the pattern starts with or consists of
an asterisk (\fB*\fP), then the sort is case insensitive.
.TP
.BR \-f " \fIfmt-str\fP, " \--format "=" \fIfmt-str\fP
Formatting string for each input.
.sp
If you need to reformat each input text, the argument to this
option is interpreted as an \fBsprintf(3)\fP format that is used
to produce each output entry.
.TP
.BR \-S " \fIsep-str\fP, " \--separation "=" \fIsep-str\fP
Separation string \- follows all but last.
.sp
Use this option if, for example, you wish a comma to appear after
each entry except the last.
.TP
.BR \--line-separation "=\fIsep-str\fP"
string at end of all lines but last.
.sp
Use this option if, for example, you wish a backslash to appear at
the end of every line, except the last.
.TP
.BR \--by-columns
Print entries in column order.
.sp
Normally, the entries are printed out in order by rows and then columns.
This option will cause the entries to be ordered within columns.
The final column, instead of the final row, may be shorter than the
others.
.TP
.BR \-i " \fIfile\fP, " \--input "=" \fIfile\fP
Input file (if not stdin).
.sp
This program normally runs as a \fBfilter\fP, reading from standard
input, columnizing and writing to standard out.  This option redirects
input to a file.
.TP
.BR \-? , " \--help"
Display extended usage information and exit.
.TP
.BR \-! , " \--more-help"
Extended usage information passed thru pager.
.TP
.BR \-> " [\fIrcfile\fP]," " \--save-opts" "[=\fIrcfile\fP]"
Save the option state to \fIrcfile\fP.  The default is the \fIlast\fP
configuration file listed in the \fBOPTION PRESETS\fP section, below.
.TP
.BR \-< " \fIrcfile\fP," " \--load-opts" "=\fIrcfile\fP," " \--no-load-opts"
Load options from \fIrcfile\fP.
The \fIno-load-opts\fP form will disable the loading
of earlier RC/INI files.  \fI--no-load-opts\fP is handled early,
out of order.
.TP
.BR \-v " [{\fIv|c|n\fP}]," " \--version" "[=\fI{v|c|n}\fP]"
Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v', a simple
version.  The `c' mode will print copyright information and `n' will
print the full copyright notice.
.SH OPTION PRESETS
Any option that is not marked as \fInot presettable\fP may be preset
by loading values from configuration ("RC" or ".INI") file(s) and values from
environment variables named:
.nf
  \fBCOLUMNS_<option-name>\fP or \fBCOLUMNS\fP
.fi
.ad
The environmental presets take precedence (are processed later than)
the configuration files.
The \fIhomerc\fP files are "\fI.\fP", and "\fI$HOME\fP".
If any of these are directories, then the file \fI.columnsrc\fP
is searched for within those directories.
