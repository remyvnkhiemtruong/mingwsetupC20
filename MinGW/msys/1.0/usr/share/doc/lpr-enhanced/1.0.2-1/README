README for lpr-enhanced-1.0.2
=============================

This package provides a rudimentary emulation of a UNIX System-V `lp', or BSD
`lpr' command line interface to a MS-Windows print spooler; it is suitable for
use with MSYS or with Cygwin. It provides more features than the simplistic
`lpr.exe' distributed with the cygutils package for both Cygwin and MSYS, but
requires additional configuration; lpr.exe does its simple job out of the box.

This is free software.  There is no warranty of any kind, not even any implied
warranty of merchantibility, nor of fitness for any particular purpose; the
author will, at no time, accept liability for damage of any kind, however
caused, resulting from the use of this software.

This software is provided in the forms of both source code and binary packages,
(for use on MSYS); however, the most convenient method of installation is from
the source code package.  To install the software in this recommended manner,
unpack the source distribution and execute (in the usual manner[*]):

  $ configure
  $ make all install

[*] For a typical system configuration, the following configure arguments are
recommended:

  $ configure --prefix=/usr --localstatedir=/var --sysconfdir=/etc

Note that installing from source code, in this manner, installs the script as
`${exec_prefix}/bin/lpr-enhanced', and also creates copies, (symbolic links on
Cygwin), providing appropriate functionality via scripts with the alternative
names `${exec_prefix}/bin/lp' and `${exec_prefix}/bin/lpr'.  Additionally, to
avoid a potential conflict with the Cygwin (and MSYS) `lpr.exe', installed as
part of the `cygutils' package on those platforms, if this program is already
installed as `${exec_prefix}/bin/lpr.exe', it will be renamed to eliminate the
conflict, as `${exec_prefix}/bin/lpr-basic.exe'.

On the other hand, if you choose to install the binary package, you should be
aware that it has been packaged for installation based on standard MSYS path
conventions, (i.e. `/' and `/usr' represent the same physical directory), and
you should unpack the distribution into your MSYS root directory.  You should
also note that, while the script is installed as `/bin/lpr-enhanced', (also to
be found as `/usr/bin/lpr-enhanced'), neither of the alternatively named copies
of the script is installed, nor is any already installed `/bin/lpr.exe' moved
out of the way.  Thus, to deploy the installed software for use (in place of
the cygutils lpr.exe), after installation you must also do:

  $ cd /usr/bin
  $ mv lpr.exe lpr-basic.exe
  $ <LN> lpr-enhanced lp
  $ <LN> lpr-enhanced lpr

where <LN> is 'ln -f', 'ln -fs', or 'cp', as desired.  (You really want to
avoid having both `lpr' and `lpr.exe' installed into the same directory; doing
so may lead to a number of problems with cygwin-1.7 and cygwin-1.5 when the
CYGWIN=transparent_exe option is set; it may also cause problems with MSYS).

Finally, regardless of which installation method you have chosen, you must
manually set up the printer definitions for your environment.  Typically, this
involves creating (or modifying) an `/etc/printcap' file, based on the sample
in `/var/spool/lp/config/example', and adjusted to suit your printer spool
configuration; (if your system supports file linking, you may also choose to
keep a linked copy of `/etc/printcap' in `/var/spool/lp/config/.active', or
on any system, to use this as an exclusive alternative configuration file).

Usage instructions are included, as comments, within the `lpr-enhanced'
script itself.
