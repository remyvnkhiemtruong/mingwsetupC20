0.10.6:
	* Rebased to cygport 0.10.6:
        	* Allows hyphens in PV (which are allowed by setup).
        	* Supports gettext 0.18+.
        	* Allow for cross-compiler toolchains in locations other
		  than /usr.
	  Note that in the future, changes from cygport will be merged
	  into mgwport, rather than rebasing.
	* Supports "relocatable" mgwport package: compiled distribution
	  can be unpacked in a different directory (e.g. /mingw/local,
	  or on a cross-devel environment under /opt/cross/whatever).
	* Minor bugfixes.

0.10.5:
	* First public test release, based on cygport-0.10.5.
