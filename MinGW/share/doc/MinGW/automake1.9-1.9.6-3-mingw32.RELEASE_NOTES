mingw automake (1.9 series)
========================================================================
The latest version in the 1.9.x series of automake, the GNU automatic
makefile generator. These scripts are packaged to work alongside other
"automakeX.Y" packages and the "automake" wrapper package (the latter
component is an intelligent wrapper system developed by the Gentoo
distribution; see its RELEASE NOTES for further information). This
release is configured to operate as part of a toolchain for developing
mingw libraries and applications (that is, native win32 binaries, as
opposed to msys-dependent ones).

Proper operation of this automake1.9 distribution requires a working
MSYS installation, as well as certain other elements available from the
MinGW team (http://www.mingw.org/) as listed below.  However, this
automake1.9 distribution was configured as part of the "mingw32"
subsystem, and should be installed into the /mingw directory (which is
usually, but not always, C:\MinGW).  Thus, automake1.9 is a hybrid:
it is configured for the "mingw32" subsystem, but unlike most mingw32
elements, requires MSYS.  This rather odd situation is necessary for a
number of reasons (see the References section below).
