mingw bzip2
===============================================================================
bzip2 is a freely available, patent free (see below), high-quality data
compressor. It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best
available techniques (the PPM family of statistical compressors), whilst being
around twice as fast at compression and six times faster at decompression.

Release: bzip2-1.0.6-4-mingw32

         bzip2-1.0.6-4-mingw32-doc.tar.gz        (FAQ, readmes, etc)

         libbz2-1.0.6-4-mingw32-dll-2.tar.gz     (redistributable DLL)

Notes:   This is a binary release of the bzip2 compression/decompression
         library, compiled for use with mingw32 applications.

         The source code is modified from that distributed by bzip.org,
         to fix various security holes, correct build errors, and add
         new features.  In addition, the original build system has been
         completely replaced by an autoconf-based one (see README.CYGMING
         for more information).

         The "src" tarball delivers the full unmodified source code from
         bzip.org, along with the relevant patches and (external) build
         driver (.mgwport) script.

         The "doc", "lic" and "man" tarballs provide the documentation
         components, as identified above, abstracted from the source
         tarball, and repackaged into a file hierarchy structure which
         is suitable for installation into the user's installed MinGW
         directory hierarchy; for a standard installation, they should
         be unpacked into the C:\MinGW directory.

         The "bin" tarball provides the bzip2.exe compression utility, along
         with several other utilities and scripts. This package should be
         unpacked into the C:\MinGW directory.

         Developers of mingw32 applications, who wish to link to the
         bzip2 libraries, will require at least the "dev" tarball; this
         provides the libbz2.a static version of the library, libbz2.dll.a
         import library, for linking to a DLL version of the library,
         and the set of C language headers common to both.  The DLL
         version of the library, libbz2-2.dll, is provided separately, by
         the "dll-2" tarball.  As in the case of the installable
         documentation, each of these tarballs should be unpacked into the
         C:\MinGW directory.

This distribution incorporates pre-built binary components, which have been
specifically compiled for the "mingw32" subsystem; in other words, they
comprise binary executables and object libraries suitable for native use on
Microsoft's 32-bit Windows operating system.  For the most part, these
binaries and object libraries have no dependencies on other entities, beyond
those provided as standard components of the operating system.  Do please be
advised, however, of the following exceptions to this general principle;
the following utility programs:--

     bzcmp
     bzdiff
     bzegrep
     bzfgrep
     bzgrep
     bzless
     bzmore

are provided in the form of Bourne shell scripts, and thus require a Bourne
shell to execute; (the MinGW Project recommends the use of their own MSYS
shell system, but other products may suffice; YMMV); these scripts CANNOT be
invoked directly from Microsoft's cmd.exe.

The preceding exception does NOT apply, in the case of:--

     bzip2.exe
     bzip2recover.exe
     bunzip2.exe
     bzcat.exe

Each of the above IS suitable for use, directly from cmd.exe.

Port Notes:

1) While upstream bzip2 creates a DLL whose functions are exported using
   the WINAPI (stdcall) calling convention, mingw.org's DLL uses the
   cdecl calling convention instead, as that is the default calling
   convention for gcc.

2) (internal:) the original, and rather dated and inflexible, build system
   has been completely replaced by a new autoconf-based one, contributed
   by Keith Marshall. This allows for (a) out-of-tree builds, (b) cross-
   compiler builds, and (c) better handling for win32/cygwin builds.

3) (internal:) The build and packaging is driven by an external .mgwport
   script, to handle the specifics of package creation and naming suitable
   for use with the mingw-get installation program.
