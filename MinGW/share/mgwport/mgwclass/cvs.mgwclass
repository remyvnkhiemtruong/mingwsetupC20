#****h* mgwclasses/cvs.mgwclass
#  SYNOPSIS
#  CVS_URI="..."
#  [CVS_BRANCH="..."]
#  [CVS_DATE="..."]
#  inherit cvs
#  DESCRIPTION
#  CVS is a centralized version control system.  It was the first widely-used
#  VCS for open-source software, but many projects have since moved to Subversion
#  or one of the distributed VCSs.
#
#  This mgwclass creates source tarballs from CVS checkouts.
#  NOTE
#  This mgwclass sets a special SRC_URI for the tarball it creates.  If
#  additional sources are required, be sure to _add_ to SRC_URI rather than
#  outright setting it.
#  REQUIRES
#  cvs
#****

# is this truly necessary?

#  DESCRIPTION
#  Address of CVS repository, usually in the form:

#  DESCRIPTION
#  Specific revision or tag to checkout.
#****

	then
		cvs_branch="-r ${CVS_BRANCH}"

#****v* cvs.mgwclass/CVS_DATE
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Specific revision date to checkout.  Preferred form is YYYY-MM-DD [HH:MM],
#  where the time is optional; the hyphens in the date can be omitted.
#  NOTE
#  If a date is specified without a time, then the time 00:00 is implied,
#  which will exclude all revisions made on the given date.  Use the
#  following day in CVS_DATE instead.
